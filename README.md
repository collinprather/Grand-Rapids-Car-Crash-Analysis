This repo contains a few notebooks where I processed [Grand Rapids car crash data](http://grdata-grandrapids.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cgr-crash-data) (courtesy of GRData), and built a model to predict if a car crash was caused by a drunk driver or not. Overall, I was very pleased with the model's predictions. To give you an idea, here is an ROC curve and confusion matrix indicating the model's prediction accuracy.

In additon, this analysis served as the backbone of my talk, "Machine Learning from Scratch", presented at the [Big Data Ignite Conference 2018](https://bigdataignite.org). The notebook that I presented on at the conference is linked [here](https://github.com/collinprather/BDI-2018-JupyterHub/blob/master/SVM_scratch.ipynb)
